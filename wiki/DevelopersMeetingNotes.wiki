In order to keep track of the statistics about secondary users' force handoffs and drops the following is implemented:
<dl>
 <dt>1. Variables for force handoff count and drop count are created. A boolean variable that holds information about last frames collision is also created.</dt>

 <dt>2. At the beginning of communication schedule advertisement collided secondary users are given priority over others and tried to be given free frequency. If they can handoff to another available frequency, number of force handoffs is incremented. Otherwise, number of drops is incremented.</dt>

 <dt>3. If secondart user drops, its communication end event is cancelled and a new communication start event is created.</dt>

 <dt><b>PS:</b> The statistics about number of collisions and number of secondary blocks were already implemented.</dt>
</dl>

Finally unit times is specified as follows:

== Issues & Decisions ==
Possion traffic implementation for secondary users at multithreaded simulation module is completed by implementing the followings:
<dl>
 <dt>1. An array that holds communication start & communication end times (depending on user's current communication state) of CR user is added to CR sensor thread class.</dt>

 <dt>2. First communication start times for each CR users is found at the beginning of the simulation.</dt>

 <dt>3. If a CR user is currently not communicating the value in the array indicates communication start time for that user. If s/he is currently communicating then the value in the array indicates communication end time.</dt>
 
 <dt>4. After the initial state all random number generations occur at the beginning of the frame loops.</dt>

 <dt><b>PS:</b> All communication and off times of the users are calculated in terms of frames.</dt>
