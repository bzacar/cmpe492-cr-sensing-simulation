== Issues & Decisions ==
Possion traffic implementation for secondary users at multithreaded simulation module is completed by implementing the followings:
<dl>
 <dt>1. An array that holds communication start & communication end times (depending on user's current communication state) of CR user is added to CR sensor thread class.</dt>

 <dt>2. First communication start times for each CR users is found at the beginning of the simulation.</dt>

 <dt>3. If a CR user is currently not communicating the value in the array indicates communication start time for that user. If s/he is currently communicating then the value in the array indicates communication end time.</dt>
 
 <dt>4. After the initial state all random number generations occur at the beginning of the frame loops.</dt>

 <dt><b>PS:</b> All communication and off times of the users are calculated in terms of frames.</dt>
